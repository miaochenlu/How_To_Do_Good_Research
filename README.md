1. Follow a grammatical <u>subject</u> as soon as possible with its <u>verb</u>.
2. Place in the stress position the “new information” you want the reader to emphasize[often the end of a sentence]. 
3. Place the person or thing whose “story” a sentence is telling at the beginning of the sentence, in the topic position.

 4. Place appropriate “<u>old information</u>” (material already stated in the discourse) in the topic position for linkage backward and contextualization forward.

5. Articulate the action of every clause or sentence in its verb.

6. In general, provide context for your reader before asking that reader to consider anything new.
7. In general, try to ensure that the relative emphases of the substance coincide with the relative expectations for emphasis raised by the structure.
